### Summary ###
This is a viewer for finding the part and color information that you will need to add a part in a .lcad file. In order for it to work properly you will first need to run misc/make_parts_xml.py against your current ldraw/parts directory to generate your own version of the parts.xml file. Once this is done you can run it like this:

```python partviewer.py```
