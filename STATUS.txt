Current:

2015-06-28: Add overlay() module for easier MOC scaling.

2015-05-19: Rename the LCadObject type to LCadBoolean.

2015-05-18: Change calling convention so that only SpecialFunctions get the
            an AST as an argument. Normal functions have their arguments
	    interpreted for them and passed in standard Python fashion. This
	    simplifies creating functions and also makes it easier to call
	    functions from Python.

2015-05-12: Add cables of various types.

2015-04-18: Add suspension as an example of how to use spring().

2015-04-15: Add artic truck crane as an example of how to use pulley-system().

2015-04-10: Change all the curve functions to return a 4 x 4 transform matrix 
	    instead of the list (x y z rx ry rz). Change the transform()
	    function to take the same arguments as matrix().

2015-04-08: Add knots(), specifically a sheet bend knot.

2015-04-03: Add pulley-system() module for 3D pulley / string creation.

2015-03-31: Add belt() module for 3D belt / chain creation.

2015-03-27: Add spring() module for spring (and helix) creation.

2015-03-23: Add Python shapes module to speed up adding primitives to a
	    model for things like tubes, axles, etc.

2015-03-16: Added pyimport() and an example of how to use your own Python 
	    functions. Changed interpreter to import modules listed in
	    modules.xml making it easier to customize.

2015-03-14: Changed to use native Python lists. Improved aref() so that it will
 	    work with native Python lists and numpy.ndarrays.

2015-03-13: Implemented function signatures to hopefully make argument parsing
	    and checking more robust.

2015-03-07: Changed chain so that a chain function will return the same list
            (x y z rx ry rz) as curve so that they can be used interchangeably.

2015-03-06: Changed the name of the project to OpenSDraw.

2015-03-05: Continuing with the disruptive changes.. The chain() and curve() functions
	    now require their arguments to be explicit lists.

2015-03-04: Changed the arguments to many of the geometry and part functions. Previously
            a function like translate would be called like this (translate (x y z) ..)
	    but this is not a standard form i.e. (function x y z). So while this could
	    be somewhat disruptive, the arguments for functions like translate have
            been changed to be explicit lists, (translate (list x y z) ..).
