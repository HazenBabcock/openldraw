OpenSDraw
=========

A CAD program for designing LEGO(R) MOCs. OpenSDraw is a domain specific
language for creating LEGO(R) models. It is a prefix notation language 
similar to Scheme or LISP that is used to specify the location of the 
bricks in the MOC. The output of a program is a LDraw format file that 
can be read by any LDraw compatible viewer such as LDView.

This project was inspired by `OpenSCAD <http://www.openscad.org/>`_.
